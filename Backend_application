Create a routes folder for setting all the routes.
Create a user.js file here for setting up routers
  
After setting up router file
 create a middlewire using express to connect routes to your application. 
      app.use('/User', Users);

For a Proper Folders structure for Server
  Create a folder named "Controllers"
    all the handlers for routes will be here.
    
  Create a folder named "models"
  
  
  routes folder has all router
  Controllers folder has all the handler (methods) for routers
  models folder have all the schemas used for database.
